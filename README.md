# slop-fired-boiler-efficiency-and-fuel-calculation
**The project is done in asociation with Dhampur sugar mills ltd.**<br>
The aim of this project is to evaluate the efficiency of the boiler and finding fuel imbalance as well as fuel accounting which shows the fuel loss during the process.<br>
Boiler efficiency can be tested by the two ways-<br> 
**1)The Direct Method**: Where the energy gain of the working fluid (water and steam) is compared with the energy content of the boiler fuel. 
**2)The Indirect Method**: Where the efficiency is the difference between the losses and the energy input.<br>
The data for this project is collected by using algorathims from **DCS**.<br>
In this project both type of **efficiecy,fuel imbalance,fuel accounting** is calculated for a 35tph slop fired boiler by analysing the data.<br>
But efficiency,fuel imbalance and fuel accounting of any capacity slop fired boiler (which uses the fuel as mentions in excel sheet) can be calculated by using this sheet and much more things can be done.
